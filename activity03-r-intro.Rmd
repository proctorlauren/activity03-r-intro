Today you will be creating and manipulating vectors, lists, and data frames to uncover a top secret message.

As you work through this document with your Team members, remember to:

- Ask questions
- Google is your friend!
  If an error is confusing, copy it into Google and see what other people are saying.
  If you don't know how to do something, search for it.
- Just because there is no error message doesn't mean everything went smoothly.
  Use the console to check each step and make sure you have accomplished what you wanted to accomplish.

Do not edit this first R code chunk.
This will allow you to knit your document and view errors within the knitted report.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(error = TRUE)
```

### Setup

Each of the following R chunks will cause an error and/or do the desired task incorrectly.  Find the mistake, and correct it to complete the intended action.

Create three vectors that contain: 1) the lower case letters, 2) the lower case letters, and 3) some punctuation marks.

```{r}
lower_case <- c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j", "k", "l", "m", "n", "o", "p", "q", "r", "s", "t", "u", "v", "w", "x", "y", "z")

upper_case <- c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I", "J", "K", "L", "M", "N", "O", "P", "Q", "R", "S", "T", "U", "V", "W", "X", "Y", "Z")

punctuation <- c(".", ",", "!", "?", "'", "\"", "(", ")", " ", "-", ";", ":")
```

Comment on what you noticed about the errors and how you used this information to correct the issues.

**Response**: We noticed a missing comma in the upper case and quotations marks as an example of a form of punctuation. We googled how to escape a quotation mark and found that we use a backslash before the quotation mark.


Make one long vector containing all the symbols.

```{r}
my_symbols <- c(lower_case, upper_case, punctuation)
```


Comment on what you noticed about the errors and how you used this information to correct the issues.

**Response**: There is a warning that the number of items in the lists does not match up. We fixed this by using the c function to generLLY combine the arguments.


Turn the `my_symbols` vector into a data frame, with the variable name "Symbol".

```{r}
my_symbols <- as.data.frame(my_symbols)
names(my_symbols) <- "symbols"
?data()
```

Comment on what you noticed about the errors and how you used this information to correct the issues.

**Response**:  To turn a vector into a data frame, we have to use as.data.fram.


Find the total number of symbols we have in our data frame.  

```{r}
len <- nrow(my_symbols)
```

Comment on what you noticed about the errors and how you used this information to correct the issues.

**Response**: we had to use a different function, nrow, which returns the number of rows present.


5. Create a new variable in your dataframe that assigns a number to each symbol.

```{r}
my_symbols$Num <- 1:len
```

Comment on what you noticed about the errors and how you used this information to correct the issues.

**Response**: We need to use a $ in front of num because it assigns things to eachother.

### Decoding the secret message.

This chunk will load up the encoded secret message data and assign it as a vector.
There are no errors here.

```{r}
# Read in full csv file
top_secret <- readr::read_csv("data/secret_code.csv", col_names = FALSE)

# Pick off only the column X1
top_secret <- top_secret$X1
```

By altering this top secret set of numbers, you will be able to create a message.
Write your own code to complete the steps below.

1. Add 14 to every number.
2. Multiply every number by 18, then subtract 257.
3. Exponentiate every number.  (That is, do e ^ [each number]. You may need to Google how to this!)
4. Square every number.

```{r}
top_secret <- as.data.frame(top_secret)
  top_secret = top_secret+14
  top_secret = (top_secret*18) -257
  top_secret = exp(top_secret)
  top_secret = top_secret^2
```

**HQ UPDATE:** Headquarters has informed you that at this stage of decoding, there should be 496 numbers in the secret message that are below 17.

5. Turn your vector of numbers into a matrix with 5 columns.
6. Separately from your top secret numbers, create a vector of all the even numbers between 1 and 502. Name it "`evens`". That is, `evens` should be an R object that contain the values 2, 4, 6, 8, ..., 502.
7. Subtract the "evens" vector from the first column of your secret message matrix.
8. Subtract 100 from all numbers 18-24th rows of the 3rd column.
9. Multiply all numbers in the 4th and 5th column by 2.
10. Turn your matrix back into a vector.

```{r}

```

**HQ UPDATE:** Headquarters has informed you that at this stage of decoding, all numbers in indices 500 and beyond are below 100.

11. Take the square root of all numbers in indices 38 to 465.
12. Round all numbers to the nearest whole number.
13. Replace all instances of the number 39 with 20.

```{r}

```

**HQ UPDATE:** Headquarters has informed you that your final message should have 421 even numbers.

## The secret message!

Use your final vector of numbers as indices for `my_symbols` to discover the final message, by running the following code:

```{r}
stringr::str_c(my_symbols$Symbol[top_secret], collapse = "")
```

Google the first line of this message, if you do not recognize it, to see what it is.
